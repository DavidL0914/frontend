### Weather App Project Plan 
We decided to make a Weather App because of its practical use and real life application. The idea is to display the temperature, humity, and precipitation and have a background that matches the weather conditions. We wanted to challenge ourselves to capture the temperature in real time, while also displaying the forecast.
