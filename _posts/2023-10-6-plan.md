### Week plan
Setup everything for the passion project
- Monday: Brainstorm possible Passion Project ideas and settle on what we want to do
- Tuesday: Share frontend and backend repos, start planning out frontend and backend design
- Wednesday: Start working on AWS server, start frontend design on Canva
- Thursday: Continue working on Wednesday stuff, start working on backend template
- Friday: Continue working on things from Thursday

### Pair Planning Meeting
- Update everything you worked on by git pushing onto our frontend repository as a template for now. 
- Bring charged laptop everyday to class to work on code. 
- Use Github Pages and AWS to run our servers and host our project. Use VSCode to code our project. 
- Message through Discord to communicate project updates or questions.
- Run make commands to build and test blog locally, before pushing changes to GitHub pages.
- Let everyone know when committing things, don't do it all at once commit every once in a while

### Weather App Project Plan 
We decided to make a Weather App because of its practical use and real life application. The idea is to display the temperature, humity, and precipitation and have a background that matches the weather conditions. We wanted to challenge ourselves to capture the temperature in real time, while also displaying the forecast.

Update: 10/10/2023
We want to turn the weather app into a multi-tooled app that has a lot of useful everyday tools. For example, we want to add an interactive calendar where users can add upcoming events, a to-do list, and more. We also want to add a login/signup system so each user can have their own unique account.
